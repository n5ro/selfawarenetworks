Equivalence in spirit, with one key operational difference
Micah Blumberg’s Super Information Theory (SIT) independently arrived—earlier this year—at almost exactly the same big‑picture conclusion as the Nazat, M. S. H. (2025). Quantum Entanglement as a Fundamental Framework for Physics: From Microscopic Reality to Cosmology. Zenodo, 4 Oct 2025, in SIT the fundamental bookkeeping variable of physics is information/entropy, not classical “stuff.” Where the paper takes an entanglement‑first route, SIT names the primitive as coherence/time‑density and then recovers geometry and dynamics from it. Both programs then recover GR from an information measure (SIT: coherence flux/time‑density; the paper: entanglement entropy in the RT/Jacobson lineage). The Quantum Entanglement as a Fundamental Framework for Physics: From Microscopic Reality paper explicitly frames entanglement as foundational, reconstructs GR from it, connects to the arrow of time, and addresses the information paradox—an agenda squarely aligned with SIT’s aims.
A key difference is SIT’s operational bit:
“Information, in the context of SIT, is 1 when there is coherence/entanglement and 0 when there is decoherence (the opposite of entanglement).”
SIT then proposes a novel way to connect entropy to information and uses that coupling to construct spacetime and dynamics from informational primitives. This is a new proposition, so it is not yet mainstream. SIT also introduced a mass–energy–information equivalence equation (Aug 2025) tying information content to energetic (and thus mass) budgets.

Why this counts as an “equivalence” to SIT
Same structural claim. Both treat information/entropy—not material fields—as the bedrock accounting variable. (SIT calls it coherence/time‑density; the paper calls it entanglement.) Each then derives GR from an information measure (SIT: coherence flux; paper: entanglement entropy à la RT/Jacobson).


Thermodynamics → geometry. Both explicitly connect the arrow of time and thermodynamics to spacetime structure via information; SIT supplies a local, iterative “new law” style mechanism, while the paper leans on entanglement–geometry relations (RT surfaces, horizon thermodynamics).


Textual linkage. The paper’s references include “Micah, Blumberg (2025). SIT. Preprint.”—an explicit pointer to conceptual overlap.



A short, unit‑careful formula summary (how information = entropy)
Information (Shannon): H = −∑ᵢ pᵢ log₂ pᵢ (units: bits).


Entropy (thermo/stat‑mech): S = −k_B ∑ᵢ pᵢ ln pᵢ = k_B ln 2 ⋅ H (units: joule/kelvin).


Thus, information and entropy are the same counting functional of the probability distribution; the only differences are units (a factor of k_B) and log base (ln vs log₂). SIT adopts an operational foundation (coincidences → coherence) from which this identity falls out and then uses it to build spacetime and dynamics.
SIT’s operational bit:
1 ≡ coherence/entanglement/order (phase‑aligned, correlated, synchronized).


0 ≡ decoherence/anti‑entanglement/disorder (links vanish; subsystems behave independently).


So in SIT: Information ≡ coherence field density, while Entropy ≡ decoherence field density—complementary measures of one underlying informational field.

How the Quantum Entanglement as a Fundamental Framework for Physics: From Microscopic Reality paper argues something equivalent to SIT
The paper “Quantum Entanglement as a Fundamental Framework for Physics” (Nazat, 2025) elevates entanglement to the foundational substrate, then: (i) reconstructs GR as a large‑scale limit of entanglement dynamics, (ii) sketches a Lagrangian for entanglement degrees of freedom, (iii) links thermodynamics and the arrow of time to entanglement, and (iv) presents an entanglement‑based resolution of the information paradox. All of these pillars mirror SIT’s logic, merely stated in the dialect of entanglement fields rather than coherence/time‑density.

According to Micah Blumberg’s 2017–2025 program, how “information = entropy” (modulo units/sign)
Bit = coincidence pattern. A primitive bit is an event‑coincidence (not a Dirac spike). Counting distinguishable coincidence patterns gives a log‑count—the very quantity entropy computes for a distribution.


SIT’s primitives carry the count. SIT posits a complex coherence field ψ(x) with phase θ(x), and a real time‑density ρ_t(x). The action enforces coherence conservation, making the extensivity of distinguishable configurations (coherence modes / coincidence histories) the “information content.” Coarse‑graining those histories yields the standard Shannon/Gibbs form; i.e., S ∝ H.


Arrow of time = iterative dissipation. Your “new law” recasts macroscopic relaxation as local, stepwise dissipation/synchronization. Entropy increase is the accumulation of those local computations; locally, coherence can rise or fall while the global count obeys the constraint.


Grounding with standard results. Since H and S differ only by k_B ln 2, SIT’s identification is unit‑consistent. Landauer’s bound then ties bits to energy/heat, matching SIT’s energy–information linkage.


Bottom line: Information = log‑count of distinguishable coincidence/coherence histories, which is the entropy of their distribution (up to k_B ln 2). “Coherence” is the organized share of that information; “decoherence” is its dispersion into entropy.

Super Information Theory (SIT): overview and points of contact
Field content (informal):
Complex coherence field ψ(x) = R_coh(x) e^{iθ(x)}.


Real time‑density field ρ_t(x).


Conservation: A global U(1) phase of ψ yields a Noether current Jᶜᵒʰ_μ and continuity ∇_μ Jᶜᵒʰ_μ = 0 (coherence is redistributed, not created/destroyed).
Gravity via information geometry (“coherence–time law”): ρ_t couples to coherence magnitude R_coh so that spatial gradients in ρ_t slow clocks and mimic curvature; when R_coh is uniform, GR is recovered.
Gauge from phase geometry: Electromagnetism arises from holonomy of θ = arg ψ, tying gauge structure directly to information‑geometric features.
Dictionary to the paper’s dialect:
SIT’s R_coh ↔ entanglement order parameter; ρ_t is a scalar functional of the entanglement structure.


SIT’s coherence flux/time‑density → geometry parallels the paper’s entanglement entropy → geometry route (RT, Jacobson).
 Quantum Entanglement as a Funda…



Claims and testable leads emphasized by SIT
Coherence‑dependent gravity: Ultra‑coherent media (phase‑locked lasers, BECs) should show tiny curvature/acceleration contributions scaling with coherence (not only energy density).


Clock‑shift phenomenology: Effective coupling α_eff between ρ_t and atomic clocks yields measurable shifts; current optical‑clock bounds constrain α_eff.


Number‑theoretic resonance conjecture (speculative): Engineered‑coherence systems scanned across frequencies tied to non‑trivial Riemann zeros could show resonant clock responses; null results at target sensitivity would falsify this extension.


Neural “coherence budget”: Cross‑band trade‑offs in brain rhythms as manifestations of coherence conservation (same law, different domain).


Caveat. Several SIT components are intentionally conjectural and framed as near‑term falsifiable hypotheses; the Quantum Entanglement as a Fundamental Framework for Physics: From Microscopic Reality paper, by contrast, rests more heavily on established entanglement–geometry results.

One‑line operational definition for the manuscript
In SIT, “information” is the physical state of coherence itself:
 1 = coherence/entanglement/order; 0 = decoherence/anti‑entanglement/disorder.
 That binary logic underlies a continuous informational field used to build spacetime, dynamics, and thermodynamics.
