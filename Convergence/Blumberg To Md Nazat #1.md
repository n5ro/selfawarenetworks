### Blumberg to MD Nazat

Why don't you come up with at least one original idea that isn't paraphrasing or saying in a different way concepts that others have already published? All I'm seeing from Md Nazat is the same concepts others previously published just phrased in a different way. All of the concepts in his various works have previous appeared in most of these 200 or so other works. All 200 or so of these authors have written works that contain concepts that are equivalent to concepts published by others after translation and mapping.

Micah Blumberg Well, all of my theories are novel. Overlapping ideas do not diminish that. Anyone can propose a theory of everything, but what truly matters is who presents a complete and rigorous version---and I have done precisely that.

God did not create knowledge as a patented asset. Similarities between ideas are natural, but what counts is who delivers the comprehensive version. Until now, I have found other proposed Theories of Everything to be nothing more than pseudoscientific gibberish.

### Blumberg to MD Nazat

"but what truly matters is who presents a complete and rigorous version" --- that's not true.\
"but what counts is who delivers the comprehensive version" --- not true.

What you are saying now is a lying defense. What's going to happen to your theories is the same thing that is starting to happen to all 200+ other similar theories that contain the same concepts. There will be a massive public mapping of all the equivalent concepts, all 200+ theories will become mainstream because it is an astonishing and an astounding fact that more than 200 people are essentially saying the same thing in different ways.

The global spotlight will be on all of these theories, and that means global scrutiny, and what people will do is use mathematics to formalize the equivalence between each of the theories, and then they will figure when equivalences first happened, who said what first, and everyone will see as plain as day, that those equivalent concepts appeared in your works rather late.

It will be mathematically proven. This is not today, but this is the near future. You will find out. Right now you are inside a bubble of illusion that is your own making.

We can translate and decode your theories "all of my theories are novel" to show that they are not actually novel. They may be phrased differently, or use different math notation, but if they behave the same, and or if they function the same, then we can prove your theories are not novel. It's not enough to phrase a concept differently to make it novel. It's not enough to write the math notation differently to make it novel. Math will show this.

I know this, because I have already performed the mathematical proofs on other papers, and I've done the sketch proofs on your papers, I just haven't published the proofs on your papers yet that show the equivalence.

### Md Nazat

Micah Blumberg, how can you say that 200 authors are all saying the same thing? My DIn theory is discrete. Another theory is based on consciousness, yet another on a wave-coding system. So? I don't see any real overlap here. Rather, you are defending a line without scrutiny.

I don't even believe a true ToE exists yet. Most works are merely unifications of forces. If you compare every work with extreme scrutiny, you will find no real similarity. Neither dark matter nor any unified model is truly settled. In one paper, I argued that string theory isn't enough; in another, I reformulated it. What would you call that---copying? I am producing various models, not sticking to the same one.

* * * * *

### Md Nazat

Micah Blumberg one theory will pass. You can't say discrete and continuous are the same. I took both and formulated as various model.\
How they are the same?

* * * * *

### Blumberg to MD Nazat

Well my argument is actually more nuanced than that, and the 200 theories on my list are not all in the same category. About 30 of them are about neuroscience and/or consciousness, the other 170 are about fundamental physics. I'm not arguing that your work is exactly the same, or that it's an exact copy.

What I'm showing in math is that your work contains concepts that other people developed first. People will ask you, when they find this out, why didn't you tell them that these other papers contain concepts that are equivalent to concepts that you are presenting as your own original work?

Where are your citations and references to papers that preceded yours in the timeline that contain "many" of the same concepts just worded differently?

So appreciate that I'm being careful with my language here, to say that your work contains many concepts that are equivalent to concepts that other people developed and published first, and yet you are presenting these equivalent concepts as if you developed them first. So all the facts about this will become widely known.

It would be less risky for you, if you were not claiming that your work was 100% original novel and new, and instead you were citing all similar works, that have similar ideas, that predated yours. Your readers then, the public, would have more trust in what you say, if you took the approach that I recommend. Cite the papers that contain concepts equivalent to what you are talking about, and in the end, it will make you look better, than how you will look, if you do not.

* * * * *

### Md Nazat

Micah Blumberg, I have included citations in my work, which you can check. The fact is, I developed this independently rather th reading someone's paper. For example --- Einstein worked with spacetime, I have the citation of Einstein. I used quantization of spacetime. I have added Wheeler, Schrödinger's and Planck's as references.

* * * * *

### Md Nazat

Micah Blumberg for an example.\
I have the main citation but for angular maximum speed I did for the first time. But backed by Einstein and others.

Universal Maximum Angular Speed for Objects in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Theoretical Upper Bound for Massless and Massive Particles. This paper has referencs which is working as supporting of my claiming. But the equations I have produced I haven't seen anywhere to be honest. So I am confident that I hope I the first to express it like this.

Exactly what I have said all along is true. It won't help you to try to convince me otherwise, I can see the facts. In the long run the facts will be obvious, apparent, and easy to understand to the masses that are considering how there are more than 200 (and probably already more than 250 assuming there are many more that I haven't found yet) theories that are essentially saying the same thing after translation and mapping.

You think people won't notice, but everyone has the internet, and everyone has AI so when they look up your theory, via a search engine, they will find a story about all these other similar theories, and they will see the math that proves equivalences, and they can verify for themselves that it's all true with AI.

You don't understand there is no escape, except to tell the whole truth. I ran a quick mapping of your latest paper "<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17179249>" and I found the same evidence that I found in your other papers.

ChatGPT is putting together a comparison for me, and already in it's thoughts it says this:\
"I'm detailing 10 conceptual equivalences, linking Nazat's and SIT's theories, including observational constraints, empirical evidence, and ensuring clarity and safety throughout."

Which is similar to other comparisons that I've done on your other papers.

Here is a preview of the future. Five years from now (or less), anyone looking up your work on Google or in any AI search engine will quickly find out these mathematically proven facts.

Count established: 12 conceptual equivalences.\

The only thing you can do to help your future situation is start being radically honest now, start by accepting that what I'm saying is the truth. That's all I have to say. That's my message to you.

"There is no absolute truth. It is relative." No it's not. With enough evidence the truth is undeniable, it's not relative.

"If I tell AI to do this, it will find a way to prove you wrong." You can try to do this, but then I can audit what your AI said with several different AI's and publish the audits that will show people that whatever bias you put into AI doesn't hold up on greater inspection. In 5 years AI will be so smart that clean up any bias that humans try to put into it automatically. No one will be able to get away with lies and misrepresentations of the truth. So no "There is no absolute truth. It is relative." --- it's not relative.

Your MOT.PDF is dated to November 2023. That's not five years ago. Do you have something earlier than that?

You are asking me if I published in peer-review but you have published on Zenodo which is self publishing, this is not what people usually mean when they say peer-review.

I'm working on a new comparison to my work based on your 2023 Mot PDF. I will share soon.\

Micah BlumbergMicah Blumberg: I never said Zenodo means peer-reviewed. I published in a repository. Truth depends on the observer and perspective. Even without bias, your paper would be refuted---because if it were truly groundbreaking, it would have already won a Nobel Prize.

You don't have to wait to give me the new model. please share the existing one. And I am reviewing soon.

You just told everyone here that 1. You have not seen my paper. and 2. That you are declaring my work to be pseudoscience before having seen it. You just gave away evidence of your plan to review my paper with deceitful bias encoded in it.

What happened to nobility and intellectual honesty? You just told on yourself, and I have a screenshot of it.

Md Nazat Sure you can write about my work, and then I will reply, and that will just draw more attention to the equivalences between our works that I have priority on. Let's start a public debate. After all the comparisons I have been running privately I am feeling very confidant about the eventual outcome. Even if you initially try to mislead people.

* * * * *

### Micah Blumberg

Here is the final comparison between MD Nazat's published work form 2023 to 2025 (I did not find earlier work), against Blumberg's published work from 2017 to 2025. There are three major behavioral/functional equivalences after translation and mapping, and the priority belongs to Blumberg on all three points of equivalence.

Here is a quote:\
"Bottom line: On the only behaviors that both lines of work ultimately share, your side publishes first (anchored 2017 → 2022 → Feb 2025), MOT 2023 is non-equivalent, and Nazat's equivalents appear only in Sept 2025. Count = 3 equivalence-with-priority items, all to Blumberg."

<https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68d1efaf9e588191965c4b2c5b79c5f7>

Here is an audit of the same findings in a different chat.\
<https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68d1f0648b8c8191bbd9a8de9ae57de7>

Note that while it is possible to get AI to say different things, or to examine things through different lens, the point that I am making here is that I believe that these points will stand up in multiple independent audits, that anyone can run for themselves with their own AI of choice.

This is not my final report, I will be including a lot of references and additional comparison to make the final report much more robust, but this is a general preview of what the facts are and what arguments are going to stand up the tallest over time, despite any attempt that you might make to create a distorted picture with AI.

My advice is always, be noble, be honest, tell the truth, don't try to distort the facts. Don't think that your battle is with me, your only real fight is between yourself and the truth. Your best defense is to be in alignment with the truth, and not try to distort the facts.
