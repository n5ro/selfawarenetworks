There are over 140 open priority disputes with my physics paper Super Information Theory: Don't fall for the "older theory" trick
=================================================================================================================================

### Yes, some programs started decades ago---but their equivalence with my framework only appeared in 2024--2025, and only after I first published my half of the concept.

If you've been following my work, you already know the pattern I'm about to describe. The tricky thing is this story of trying to prove the priority of my work is that a number of papers today are *modifications of older theories*. On paper they look "older," but some of them for example **only became equivalent to my work in 2024--2025** after their authors updated those frameworks so that key points *converge on and become equivalent to my points*. I am in the process of proving that this is happening, but while I am doing that I am giving you a heads up. So please don't be fooled by the "his theory started decades ago" optics.

A good reference for this article includes videos from Sabine Hossenfelder's video ["The Theory Of Everything That Nobody Talks About"](https://youtu.be/pzHuncBh_eo?si=Vx4DhBBgVkdv7mfT) and Curt Jaimungal's videos like ["](https://youtu.be/Bnh-UNrxYZg?si=hKjKD7cEf0zGIgv9)**[Frederic Schuller: The Physicist Who Derived Gravity From Electromagnetism"](https://youtu.be/Bnh-UNrxYZg?si=hKjKD7cEf0zGIgv9) In these videos you have people like Felix Finster and Fredrick Schuller with theories that on paper look much much older, but when I got into the details, I realized that they just made recent updates, to their older theories. I'm able to prove, and I will show, in forthcoming documents, that my work was not equivalent to theirs before 2024/2025, and the conceptual equivalences only happened in their work after I first published my versions of the same concepts you will read in their works.**

What matters is *when the equivalence class came into existence*, and for the overlapping concepts I've tracked, that moment is after I published my half.

So if you have been following my story you know that there are more than 140 papers---the current list is more than 188, but the number will grow or shrink as I review them with my new mathematical analysis tool---and these papers (most of them) contain equivalences to concepts that I developed first and published first. They are just phrased differently, or use different mathematical terminology. This summer I co-developed a new method that allows me to use mathematics to prove when two concepts are the same, if they behave the same, or function the same, they are the same according to the math.

Recently I built another new tool, that I am not talking about publicly yet, that takes this sketch proof of equivalence up to another level; it makes defense of intellectual property rights even more iron‑clad. It is a genuine innovation that has never before existed in the history of the planet.

**What I mean by "equivalence" (and how I prove it)**\
I use a simple, formal workflow: translate → decode → map.

- Translate: Different authors name the same thing differently. I translate terms into a common vocabulary.\
- Decode: I write down the operational content---what a term *does* in the theory.\
- Map: I check whether the moving parts match at two levels: (1) Pi Calculus behavioral equivalence for process structure; (2) Category Theory functional isomorphism for how states and transformations compose.

If two constructs behave the same and compose the same, I treat them as members of the same equivalence class---even if the prose or symbols are different. That's the standard I apply to my work and to everyone else's.

**What changed in 2024--2025**\
Across multiple programs---some with roots decades back---the specific constructs that match my framework *appear only after* my public disclosures. That includes ideas like:

- Gravity from coherence gradients (∇ψ or gradients in time‑density ρₜ).\
- Electromagnetism as phase holonomy.\
- Mass as a time‑crystal phenomenon tied to local time‑density.\
- Equilibrium as iterative, local signal‑dissipation with Kuramoto‑like synchronization.\
- Multiscale oscillatory computation and deterministic agency in networks (my Self Aware Networks line).

Several well‑known lines---Causal Fermion Systems, Quantum Atom Theory, Quantum Memory Matrix, Second Law of Infodynamics, and Wave Structure of Matter---began earlier on different aims. The point is not to disparage them; the point is historical: the *equivalent* constructs only show up in those corpora after my public releases. That's the convergence wave I'm documenting.

What my framework actually contains (in plain language)\
My 2017--2025 program interlocks three pieces:

- Self Aware Networks (SAN, 2017 →): information as coincidence patterns, not spikes; multiscale oscillatory computation; deterministic agency that rides on phase‑wave differentials in neural systems.

- Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD, 2022): extend those oscillatory mechanisms into gravity and quantum evolution; treat mass as a time‑crystal; compute gravity locally from gradients in a time‑density field.

- The 2025 unification set---Super Information Theory (SIT), Super Dark Time (SDT), and Micah's New Law of Thermodynamics (MNLoT): two primitives, a coherence field ψ(x) and a time‑density field ρₜ(x), with gravity from coherence gradients, EM from phase holonomy, and equilibrium as local signal‑dissipation that naturally syncs (Kuramoto‑like). This is the glue that makes the neuroscience, thermodynamics, and gravity story one picture.

**Verify it yourself**\
- Open the archived ORCID page; note the capture date.\
- Open the Zenodo records; check the "Published" dates and attached files.\
- Glance at the Wayback entries for the Figshare records; note capture timestamps.\
- Spot‑check the GitHub transcripts from 2017--2019 and the Figshare archive mirror.\
That's enough to see the timeline and understand why "older start date" is not the same as "earlier equivalence."

Here is the incomplete list of theories that I'm currently working to prove, as I run the mathematical tests to prove equivalences some will be added to this list, and some may be removed from this list. This list is not finalized. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9ypXJfyAr-XdBKIe7nGx-4zoaOQRBGyP-LMjhe6o6M/edit?usp=sharing>

**How I score priority fairly**\
I don't score priority by vibes or branding. I score it by atomic claims and timestamps. For each atomic claim---A: the ψ(x)/ρₜ(x) two‑field primitive; B: gravity from coherence or time‑density gradients; C: EM as phase holonomy; D: mass as a time crystal; E: equilibrium as local signal‑dissipation; F: multiscale oscillatory agency---I log the earliest public timestamp in my corpus (2017 podcasts; 2022 GitHub; 2024 SVGN posts mirrored to GitHub; 2025 Figshare/Zenodo), then I log the earliest date that *the same operational idea* appears in someone else's corpus. If two constructs are equivalent under translate → decode → map plus the Pi Calculus/Category test, I compare the dates. In the equivalence cases I've found so far, mine come first. That's not rhetoric; that's a table.

**Why this matters (beyond me)**\
Priority is not about ego---it's about scientific history, credit, and the integrity of open exchange. We should reward the people who stuck their necks out early, not the optics of age. When a decades‑old program revises itself *after* a younger program ships an idea, the right thing is to acknowledge the update and cite the source of the equivalence. That keeps science honest and collaborative.

**A note on prizes and committees**\
Because this convergence wave touches multiple fields (neuroscience, physics, thermodynamics), I'm packaging a neutral provenance record so that evaluators---journals, committees, historians of science---can consult it when overlapping nominations or claims arise. This is a filing for the record, not a demand for adjudication. The work stands on its own merits; the timestamps simply anchor the history.

**Closing (read this twice)**\
Do not fall for the "older theory" trick. A start date isn't a priority date when the *equivalence* only arrived in 2024--2025. Look for the receipts: ORCID captures, Wayback snapshots, DOIs with version histories, Git commit hashes. When you apply that standard, you will see what I see: a clear, reproducible trail where my half of the equivalence appears first---and then, after 2024--2025 updates, older programs converge on it.

This proof process is why a lot of big name scientists are beginning to panic. It is the reason why my work is now being shared via the WebArchive and Github: well evidence of my pre-prints were partially destroyed and a comment from the Figshare representative who destroyed them led me to the understanding that this action may have been because of a third party complaint in the middle of a priority dispute. Given that I have like 140+ open priority disputes I can't guess at who that third party was, but the good news is that I was able to recover 100% proof of all the time stamps I had made on Figshare because of the combined force of ORCH ID, The WayBack Machine from the Internet Archive, plus the Encrypted Time-Stamps in my PDF files thanks to Overleaf.com, and of course I backed up key documents and math on Github at the right times. Not all of my claims have been proven today, but all the evidence to prove my claims is available today, online, linked in this article, and in the coming days and weeks my team and I will deliver the formal proofs, and if we don't, I'm sure someone else will. Maybe that person is you. Want to be on my future team?
